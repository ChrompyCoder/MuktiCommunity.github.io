## More about us:

Mukti is more than just a student club—it’s a growing community of over 650 members across India who are passionate about technology and learning by doing. 
`We’re all about taking the theoretical stuff we learn in class and turning it into real-world skills that actually matter?` 
> Sure, we’re all engineers, but how many of us have been taught basic skills like soldering in our curriculum? Not many! And yet, it’s such an essential skill. At Mukti, we believe the best way to learn is by **getting our hands dirty with projects we build together as a community**.

As the Sanskrit saying goes, 

> **"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन"** ("Your right is to perform your duty, not to the fruits of your actions").

We focus on doing the work, and the learning comes naturally.

We’re here to fill in the gaps that traditional education often overlooks. Whether it’s learning how to secure a network, contribute to a FOSS project, or mastering system 
administration, we’ve got you covered. Our workshops, hackathons, and collaborative projects aren’t just about boosting your resume—they’re about giving you the confidence to 
tackle real challenges and make a difference. Plus, with our presence at national and international forums, you’ll have the chance to show off your skills and learn from others 
in the global tech community. 

Remember the Sanskrit wisdom, 

> **"विद्या ददाति विनयं"** ("Knowledge brings humility").

At Mukti, we believe in gaining knowledge through action, collaboration, and making technology accessible for everyone, with humility and a willingness to learn.
