Mukti has had the privilege of collaborating with some of the most esteemed organizations in the FOSS community, including **[IIT Bombayâ€™s Trust Lab](https://trustlab.iitb.ac.in/), [Foss United](https://fossunited.org/), and [DeepRoot Linux](https://deeproot.in/)**.

Our partnership with **Trust Lab at IITB** was particularly memorable during their **FOSSx event**, where Mukti served as the knowledge partner. This collaboration allowed us to share our expertise, exchange ideas, and contribute to meaningful discussions on the future of open-source technologies. We mentored 100+ teams across India and worked with the students to develop and produce quality whitepapers on OpenSource Cybersecurity tools.

We are also a Community partner with the popular DebUtsav - a festival to celebrate the Debian Linux Distribution and network with other fellow enthusiasts.


We are also proud to be one of the [FOSS clubs](https://fossunited.org/clubs/mukti) supported by **Foss United**, an organization dedicated to fostering the growth of open-source software in India. Their support has been instrumental in our journey, providing us with resources, guidance, and a platform to connect with the broader FOSS community.

Additionally, Mukti has had the honor of being invited to IndiaFOSS, organized by Foss United, where we have served as a reliable community partner. These experiences have not only strengthened our ties within the open-source ecosystem but have also enabled us to grow as a community committed to the ideals of freedom and collaboration in technology.
